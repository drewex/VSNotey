VSNotey


VSNotey allows you to have a quick notepad to type out thoughts without leaving the IDE. I wrote this extension because myself and a co worker got tired of switching between IDE and notepad or a physical jotter.

For now VS Notey only allows you type in text as you work, text is lost when you close IDE.
